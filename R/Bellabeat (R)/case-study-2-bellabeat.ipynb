Ask \nOur **business task** is to leverage the insights of knowing how consumers use their smart device and what are their daily habits. This knowledge could reveal more opportunities for growth, enhance **Bellabeat** products,  and make data-driven decisions in future investments. \n\n\nOur stakeholders are:\n\n* **Urška Sršen**: Bellabeat’s cofounder and Chief Creative Officer\n* **Sando Mur**: Mathematician and Bellabeat’s cofounder; key member of the Bellabeat executive team\n* **Bellabeat marketing analytics team**: A team of data analysts responsible for collecting, analyzing, and\nreporting data that helps guide Bellabeat’s marketing strategy. You joined this team six months ago and have been busy learning about Bellabeat’’s mission and business goals — as well as how you, as a junior data analyst, can help Bellabeat achieve them.\n\n\n## 2. Prepare\nWe have used public data that explores smart device users’ daily habits from **Kaggle**: [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit)  (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through Mobius). This Kaggle data set contains 18 tables with personal fitness information from thirty Fitbit users who consented to the submission of personal tracker data. From these 18 table, we will only use two of them: \n\n* **dailyActivity_merged.csv** (`activity` from now on): this table put together activity information from other tables (steps, distance, minutes of active, moderate or light activity, etc.)\n* **sleepDay_merged.csv** (`sleep` from now on): this table summarize sleeping information.\n\n\n\n### 2.1. Data credibility\n\nThe data we are using does not comply with the principles of good data (\"**ROCCC**\") because:\n\n* It is **not reliable** for several reasons. First, this dataset is supposed to track 30 eligible Fitbit users but it contains 33 different Ids. In addition, \naccording to the website [Business of Apps](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/fitbit-statistics/), Fitbit had 31 million of active users in 2020 (data provided by Fitbit company). Bearing in mind this population, a confidence level of 95%, and a sample size of 30 people (which is the minimum sample size required according to  the **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**), we would have a margin of error of 17.9%, which is extremely high. \n\n* It is **not original**. This data was collected from Amazon Mechanical Turk but we got to it through a third party source, in this case a Kaggle user.\n\n* It is **not comprehensive**. Exploring this data we want to extract insights for women products but we do not know the sex of Fitbit users, nor their age, if they have kids,... Also, this data was collected over the course of two months, which can bias results: it is widely known that gyms are hectic before summer or after Christmas holidays. The activity can vary a lot depending on the month of the year. \n\n* It is not **current** as this data was collected in 2016, eight years ago.\n\n* It is **cited**, although it is third-party data, generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk.\n\nWith all that said, the conclusions and insights we can take from this analysis must be taken cautiously and as mere guidance.\n\n\n### 2.2. Data integrity\n\nAccording to the principles of data integrity:\n\n* The data is **valid** as it conforms to certain requirements for specific types of information.\n* We can assume the data on `activity` and `sleep` tables is **accurate** as it is taken automatically from the Fitbit device, although we can not guarantee it. \n* The data is **not complete** because we only have information from 24 users in the `sleep` table, distinct from the 33 different users in the `activity` table. \n* The data is **not consistent** as the format of date and datetime differs across the tables.\n\n\n\n### 2.3.

Trends and insights identified\n\n* We would have expected that people who exercise more, also sleep more but we can not confirm this hypothesis. Our analysis tells us that it does not matter how much the participants exercise, they are going to have a good rest.\n* Participant spent 78.2% of the time in a *sedentary* mode, followed by 18.5% of the mean time spent in a *light*.\n* 71% of the distance traveled was in *light* intensity.\n* Only three days of the week (Sundays, Wednesdays and Saturdays) the participants slept an average minimum of 420 minutes (7 hours).\n* 88% of participants spent less than 2000 calories.\n\n\n### 6.2. Recommendations\n\nAs mentioned before, the insights taken from this analysis must be taken cautiously. Our recommendations for Bellabeat in order to improve its growth are:\n\n* **Bellabeat app** should have notifications when users spend too much time in a sedentary mode, when they do not get their objective, or when they have not spend a certain amount of calories.\n\n* **Bellabeat leaf** should be able to track sleep time automatically.\n\n* **Bellabeat** should track the time users exercise. This has a huge influence in a good sleep at night. High intensity exercise shoot adrenaline and it can make harder switching off when bed time arrives.\n\n* **Bellabeat** should take a new data analysis with their own data to get more accurate insights and to be able to make the most of their efforts.\n","metadata":{}}]}
